    <h1>Trevor Bauer loses tough game</h1>

    <article>
      The Dodgers co-ace lost another tough game last night, giving up two solo
      home runs to the Houston Astros. The Dodgers offense once again could not
      muster a lot of runs, something that frequently happens when Bauer takes
      the mound.
